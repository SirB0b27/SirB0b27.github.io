Assignment 3 - Due: November 1st
---------------------------------
Using the NJIT MySQL server you will create a database table(s) that contains 30 dental patient records.

Your records will have the following fields associated with a patient : 
- Patron Name (First and Last)
- Patron Password
- Patron ID Number (8 digit)
- Patron Email Address
- Dental Appointment Schedule (Dentist Name, Type of Procedure, Date and Time of Appointment(s))



====================================================================================================================
You will also need information about the dentist that contains a list of procedures.

Your records will have the following fields:
- Name of Dentist
- Type of Procedure (for example cleaning, filling, root canal, crown, bridge, etc.)
- Date and Time of Appointment(s)



===================================================================================================================== 
Once the database(s) are created you are to design a form (how the form looks is up to you) that will allow the 
user to access your databases and print out the table(s) containing the patientsâ€™ records you created and the list
of procedures you created. I will need to have access to your original DB file(s) to verify that information printed
is indeed what is stored within your DB table(s). You should upload the table(s) as a .csv file in Canvas.


Upload your file(s) to the public_html folder of your AFS account.

AlSO please upload your files and a url where the files are contained in "Canvas".
