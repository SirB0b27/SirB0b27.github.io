The Assignment:

 

This assignment will build upon Assignment Two and Three. You will no longer use an
array to verify data from theform you created in Assignment 2 rather you will use the 
database your created in Assignment 3.

 

In this assignment you are to use the form created in Assignment 2 that allows a user 
to login to the SG using their Patient Name, Patient Password and Patient ID Number. 
Validation of inputted data should be done.  The form will also need to verify the 
information (Patient Name, Patient Password and Patient ID Number) against your 
database table you created in Assignment 3. Once the Patient Name, Patient Password 
and Patient ID Number are validated/verified the user should be directed to a GUI based 
upon the option selected in the drop down menu.  


========================================================================================


The options were as follows:
- Searching for a patient’s records (no GUI required just a print of the patient’s 
    appointments needed)

- Schedule an Appointment (GUI that allows scheduling of a new appointment for the 
    patient)

- Cancelling an Appointment (GUI that allows for the removal of a appointment from 
    the patient’s schedule)

- Creating an account if the patient does not have one (GUI allowing input of essential
    information to create an account for a patient)
 

========================================================================================


Based upon the option chosen one of the following actions occurs:

- If the user chooses the Viewing the given patient’s records/Search Schedule option you
     will display a table showing the individual’s records which will contain the 
     Patient’s Name, Patient’s Password, Patient’s ID Number, Patient’s Email, and all 
     the appointments the patient has scheduled (date/time/dentist/type of appointment).

- If the Patient chooses the Schedule an Appointment option you will allow the user to 
    schedule an appointment and insert that appointment 
    (consists of date/time/dentist/type of appointment)

- If the Patient chooses the Remove a Appointment option the system should delete the 
    appointment from their schedule.

- If the Patient chooses Register/Create an Account the user should be asked to create 
    a Patient Name, Patient Password, Patient ID Number and Patient Email, which should 
    be stored in the appropriate DB table.


=========================================================================================


Your database table should be updated accordingly based upon the option chosen. Once 
updated the system should display the customer’s account before the change was made 
and after thus allowing the user to see what changes were made.

 

Upload your files to the public_html folder of your AFS account. Please include all 
files (url, code and csv).

 

ALSO, please upload your files and a url where the files are contained in "Canvas".
