<h2>Tamil Nadu</h2>
<P1>
    Tamil Nadu, a state of India, is located in the extreme south of the Indian subcontinent. It it bounded by<Br />
    the Indian Ocean to the east and south, and Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to the west, northwest<Br />
    and north respectively. The capital is Chennai (Madras), on the coast in the northern portion of thestate.
    <Br />
</p1>


<H2>History</h2>
<p1>
    The history of Tamil Nadu begins with three powers: the Chera, the Chola and the Pandyas. From mid-6th <br />
    century until the 9th century, the Chalukyas of Badami, the Pallawas of Kanchu (now Kanchipuram) and the<bR />
    Pandyas of Madurai fought a series of wars. This period was marked at the revival fo Hinduism, and<bR />
    advancement of the fine arts. From about 850, Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Cholas, and in the 14th century<bR />
    the Hindu kingdom Vijayanagar became prominent. During the 300 years of rule under Vijayanagar, Telegu<bR />
    speaking government officials were introduced. In the 1640, East Asia Company, part of England, took<bR />
    control on India, and Tamil Nadu was named: Madraspatnam. After 1947, the Indian Independence,<Br />
    Madraspatnam was broken down until 1968, when Madraspatnam was officially named: Tamil Nadu.
